    <font size="5" face="helvetica">
      Sales is an art. An art practiced by millions of professionals in their everyday life.
      But, what makes a mere percentage of those people successful? It is the art of <em>closing.</em>The ability to
      gain trust, provide value at the same time, and make them so convinced that they want YOU to take their money. Providing value should be the topmost goal of a salesman. Afterall, nobody
      wants a worthless piece of product that won't bring any change in their life, or...do they?

    <font size="6" face="calibri">The difference between a buyer and a non-buyer</font>  
  </h2>
  <p>
    <font size="5" face="helvetica">
      Are you a buyer?, or are you a non-buyer?, Well if you are a buyer, it is easier to convince you to buy a product and if you're a non-buyer,
      which is, if you hesitate a lot, think a lot and take time to make your expenditure decisions, it is difficult to convince you. That doesn't
      mean it is totally impossible. There are various strategies for closing a person, but it works out differently for each individual.
      But, there is something in common between both the types of people, the buyers and the non-buyers, and that is the <em>Human Psychology.</em>

  <h2>
    <font size="6" face="calibri">Understanding the Human Psychology</font>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <font size="5" face="helvetica">Humans have a tendency to judge a person in the very first seconds they meet, the appearance, the body language, confidence,
      the way of talking, etc. My mother used to tell me when I was a kid, to never judge a person in the first contact, "but mom, it's Psychology, afterall I'm
      Human". Yes, it matters what you wear, how you look, and the way you act. I mean come on, would you be convinced if I tried to sell
      you something looking like I live in a box under the bridge and sound like I take 10 qualuudes a day?, ofcourse NOT. And if you do buy, you're one of the very few. Most people won't,
      which is why you need to focus on how<em> you appear, your body language, mannerisms, and tonality.</em>

  <h2>
    <font size="6" face="calibri">5 Strategies to close anyone</font>
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>
        <font size="5" face="arial"> Body language </font>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <font size="5" face="calibri">You're a man of culture and you need to prove
          that with your body language. When you talk, There's a flow, you don't need to jump out of your chair,
          but there's this sense of urgency and excitement that you need to show, need to move your hands, make eye contact,
          explain in such a way that the person you're closing never loses attention off of you- maintain their attention at ALL times.</font>
      </p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <h3>
        <font size="5" face="arial"> Perfect tonality </font>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <font size="5" face="calibri">"Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm"-Ralph Waldo Emerson. This
          is the statement that every salesman needs to carve it inside themselves, <em>enthusiasm.</em> As The wolf of the wall street, Jordan Belfort says
          "bottled enthusiasm", it is definetely the most important part of a sales pitch. You want to have that punch in your
          voice, not too loud, not too soft, not too dead, just the right amount of tone which shows how much you care
          about the customer and your product. You want to sound like you genuinely care about this deal(which you do) and want to
          help them bring a change in their life for the betterment. </font>
      </p>
    </li><br />
    <li>
      <h3>
        <font size="5" face="arial">Build long-term professional relations</font>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <font size="5" face="calibri"> You're not here to sell some scam and run away, are you?
          if you are, get off this page immediately. You always want to create <b>long-term professional relations</b> with your customer.
          Show them, tell them, make them realize that you're the only one they can trust and you will make sure
          their returns are fulfilled. Get them hooked to your trust, and they will be hooked to your product.</font>
      </p>
    </li><br />
    <li>
      <h3>
        <font size="5" face="arial">Have control of the conversation</font>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <font size="5" face="calibri"> NEVER EVER let the other person take control of the conversation,
          or else you will lose the hold of the sale completely. You want to ask them questions and build a
          rapport, not the other way round. Ask questions, Build a rapport. Understand their problem,
          and provide with a solution. Voila, The sale is all yours. </font>
      </p>
    </li> <br />
    <li>


      <h3>
        <font size="5" face="arial">Don't just sell to sell, sell to help</font>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <font size="5" face="calibri"> Believe me, you don't wanna sell just to make money. Making money
          is a by-product of providing the best services, and the best solution to a given problem. Ask
          your customer what problems they face relating to what you're going to sell, and then explain them
          how your product is that solution they absolutely need.</font>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>
    <font size="6" face="calibri">Conclusion</font>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <font size="5" face="helvetica">Closing is more of how you sell and less of what you sell. To master closing, there are many different strategies
      for handling objections, clearing doubts, building trust, etc, than what is covered in this blog. But, These 5 strategies are one of the fundamental
      things for closing and getting profitable results, which every salesman should implement in their professional life, as well as personal, for which everything is a by-product, of providing
      <em>value</em> in this world.
